/**
 * Project 1, task 2: Implement a Dynamic-Programming based Word-Break Tokenizer.
 *
 * Word-break is a problem where given a dictionary and a string (text with all white spaces removed),
 * determine how to break the string into sequence of words.
 * For example:
 * input string "catanddog" is broken to tokens ["cat", "and", "dog"]
 *
 * We provide an English dictionary corpus with frequency information in "resources/cs221_frequency_dictionary_en.txt".
 * Use frequency statistics to choose the optimal way when there are many alternatives to break a string.
 * For example,
 * input string is "ai",
 * dictionary and probability is: "a": 0.1, "i": 0.1, and "ai": "0.05".
 *
 * Alternative 1: ["a", "i"], with probability p("a") * p("i") = 0.01
 * Alternative 2: ["ai"], with probability p("ai") = 0.05
 * Finally, ["ai"] is chosen as result because it has higher probability.
 *
 * Requirements:
 *  - Use Dynamic Programming for efficiency purposes.
 *  - Use the the given dictionary corpus and frequency statistics to determine optimal alternative.
 *      The probability is calculated as the product of each token's probability, assuming the tokens are independent.
 *  - A match in dictionary is case insensitive. Output tokens should all be in lower case.
 *  - Stop words should be removed.
 *  - If there's no possible way to break the string, throw an exception.
 *
